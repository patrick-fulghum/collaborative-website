This Mastermind game was pair programmed in vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS by Johanna Fulghum and Giulia Lake.

We used canvas to render the cursor balls, styled the game using CSS, and wrote the game logic and rendered the game using Javascript. 

For further improvements:
Link to a separate page that has the rules of the game. We purposely decided not to crowd the screen with the instructions.
Style the submit button.
Create thorough tests for the game logic to ensure it works in every situation. 
Write a reset game button so that you can restart the game without refreshing. 
Include a visualization where when you win the balls fly all over the screen like in spider soliitare. 

Special thanks to Mike Semko, John Dominguez, Patrick Fulghum and Alice Kong for their guidance and creative suggestions!
